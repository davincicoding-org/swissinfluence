It cannot be ruled out that the data collected in this way is processed in the USA.</p><p>This is initially data such as IP address, date, time and page visited. If the user is logged into his user account of the respective network during this time, the network operator may be able to assign the collected information of the specific visit of the user to the personal account of the user. If the user interacts via a \"Share\" button of the respective network, this information can be stored in the user's personal user account and may be published. If the user wants to prevent the collected information from being directly assigned to his user account, he must log out before clicking on the graphic.
